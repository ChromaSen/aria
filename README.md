# 4R1A
> [!IMPORTANT]
> After careful reconsideration from the team, Y2Kuntz and assets pertaining to the chracter are removed from the repo. 

This is the official repository for 4R1A (pronounced aria), containing the original project files of the visuals and music as well as the code that helped make this (now scrapped) project possible.

This project was scrapped due to complications with implementing assets such as the battle system and some of the members not wanting to associate with Funkin' as a whole after this mod was "complete".
## Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must update Haxe to 4.3.0 or higher in order to compile. Be sure to also set Flixel to version 5.2.2 and Flixel-addons to version 3.0.2.

Open up this directory in a command line (PowerShell, Command Prompt, Terminal, etc.) and running `haxelib install hmm`. After the command is done running, run `haxelib run hmm install` to install the required libraries. 
Compile this game by running `lime test (windows/mac/linux)` like you would any other installation of Psych Engine.
