# Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must update Haxe to 4.3.0 or higher in order to compile.

Open up this directory in a command line (PowerShell, Command Prompt, Terminal, etc.) and running `haxelib install hmm`. After the command is done running, run `haxelib run hmm install` to install the required libraries. 
Compile this game by running `lime test (windows/mac/linux)` like you would any other installation of Psych Engine.
